                <!-- Content - Bio-->
                    <p>Hi everyone! Welcome to my portfolio page. I am originally from Syracuse, New York, but I have lived in Raleigh for the last 8 years. I came to North Carolina for college where I received bachelor's degrees in International Business and Spanish from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. I moved to Raleigh after graduation and have been there ever since.</p>
                
                    <p>So how did I become a developer? After college, I really struggled finding a career. Fortunately for me, it was during this time that I found the woman of my dreams and I asked her to be my wife. Dilek really helped me in my soul searching and I figured out how to tie my passions and goals in life with a possible career. I decided to find a career that allowed me to pursue my passions for traveling, learning languages, and technology. It was only after I had decided which career path to follow that I discovered programming. It complimented my loves for languages and technology. It was also a position that would give me the freedom to work remotely, so I would not be tied down to one area and I could pursue my passion to travel. When all was said and done, this career choice was a no-brainer!</p>
                    
                    <p>My education started with a web-development program at UNC-Chapel Hill where I learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Git, C#, ASP.Net. My goal with this program was to get my feet wet in the programming world and determine what kind of developer I wanted to be. This portfolio is just a sample of my work. I hope to take the skills Iâ€™ve learned through my studies to accomplish the goals and aspirations of your clients and company. I hope you like what you see. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at <a href="mailto:jpbrown1023@gmail.com" target="_blank">jpbrown1023@gmail.com</a>. Thanks for visiting my page!</p>
